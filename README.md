# Churn_and_Revenue_Analysis

**Introduction:** A churn and revenue analysis for users of a gaming event for an online gaming company is performed here: [Churn_and_Revenue_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/nateofspades/Churn_and_Revenue_Analysis/blob/master/Churn_and_Revenue_Analysis.ipynb). Users engage in various ordered missions and could churn (i.e. leave the platform entirely) at any given mission. The analysis investigates which missions result in the highest churn, how player level correlates to mission churn, the total revenue generated for the event, how player level correlates to revenue generated for the company, and suggestions for improvement based on these findings. Below is an overview of what the notebook consists of.

**Curious Observation and Data Preprocessing:** First I make the curious observation that the numbers representing various missions are all multiples of 23, and I acknowledge that this arouses some skepticism in the data's validity. I also preprocess the data before I begin the official churn and revenue analyses.

**Churn Analysis - Question 1:** Which missions experience the most churn?

**Churn Analysis - Question 2:** How does player level correlate to mission churn?

**Revenue Analysis - Question 1:** What is the total revenue generated for the gaming event?

**Revenue Analysis - Question 2:** How does player level correlate to revenue generated for the company?

**Possible Improvements for Future Events:**



The dataset (test_data_analyst.csv) contained sensitive business information and has therefore not been included in this repository.
